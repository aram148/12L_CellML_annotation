# 12L_CellML_annotation
A repository dedicated to all things annotation in the 12 Labours research program at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute.

Here you can find an example annotation pipeline using jupyter notebooks. The implementation requires libomexmeta (https://github.com/sys-bio/libOmexMeta), pandas
and wget. 

All neccessary information needed for the pipeline are stored in the csv file, including ontology id's for sources, sinks and mediators, as well as
the main model elements found in the repository. Any new lists must be completed in the form shown in the example csv file.
